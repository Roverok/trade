# Trade

Trade is a mobile web app where you can buy/sell stocks at what should be approximately their current price, using virtual currency.  The idea is to either pratice, try out theories, or just have fun.


# Usage

You can either install your own server, or just go to http://trade.kevinbedi.com on your phone and add it to your homescreen for the best experience.

To install, clone, run `npm install`, and then `node app.js`.  The site will be hosted on port 80 by default, modify the `app.js` for now to change the port if desired.
